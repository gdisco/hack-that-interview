--- Basic Declarations ---

public class MyClassName {
   private Type iVar1;
   private Type iVar2;

   public MyClassName(Type arg1, Type arg2) {
      iVar1 = arg1;
      iVar2 = arg2;
   }

   public returnType publicMethod(Type arg) {
      return returnType;
   }

   // It appearts to be Java convention to use private backers with explicit
   // public setters and getters
   public Type getiVar1 {
      return iVar1;
   }

   public void setiVar1(Type newValue) {
      iVar1 = newValue;
   }

   // Etc.
}

--- Access Modifiers ---
Class Level:
public: visible to all classes anywhere
package-private (no modifier): visible only within its package

Member Level:
public: Visible to all classes anywhere
private: Can only be accessed in its own class
protected: package-private, plus visible to subclasses in other packages
package-private (no modifier): visible only within its package

RULE OF THUMB: Choose private unless you have a good reason not to, especially for fields (aka ivars)

--- STATIC and Class Members ---
static modifier makes anything, variable or method, associated with the class instead of any instance.
** Biggest gotcha: class methods can't use `this` or access ivars without the help of an object.

Example:

public class Bicycle {
   private int cadence;
   private int gear;
   private int speed;
   private int id;

   // Increments with every bicycle made
   private static int numberOfBicycles;

   public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startGear, int startSpeed) {
      cadence = startCadence;
      gear = startGear;
      speed = startSpeed;
      id = ++numberOfBicycles; // Gives each bike a unique ID.
   }
   
   // Gives public access to the private static variable.
   public static int getNumberOfBicycles {
      return numberOfBicycles;
   }
}

--- Misc other modifiers ---
final: makes something constant. NAME_LIKE_THIS. If value known at compile-time, compile time constant.

--- Initializing Fields ---
static initialization blocks: static { initialize static variables; }. Used to initialize class variables
                              when more than simple assignment is required. As many as you want, run in order
                              listed. Just making a private static method is more readable and reusable.

initialization blocks: { initialize normal variables; }. Copied into every constructor.
final methods: don't use normal methods for ivar initialization. Use constructors or final methods.

--- Terminology as Distinct from Objective-C ---
   obj-c         Java
"property"      "field"
"message"       "method"
"initializer"   "constructor"

--- Garbage Collection ---
Objects are deallocated automatically when the program has no more references to them. Can remove references by
setting object to nil.
