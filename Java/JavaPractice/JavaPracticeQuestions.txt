1. Consider the following (read in Bill Nye's voice): 
public class IdentifyMyParts {
   public static int x = 7;
   public int y = 3;
}
a. class variables? x.
b. instance variables? y.
c. What is the output of the following code?

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);

ANSWER
a.y = 5
b.y = 6
a.x = 2
b.x = 2
IdentifyMyParts.x = 2

2. Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card from a deck of cards. Playing cards have two distinguishing properties: rank and suit.
